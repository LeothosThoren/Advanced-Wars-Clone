This is my Advanced Wars clone project's source code by Serge-David.

At this early stage in development (pre-alpha) the code is fairly messy as I hack together the features until they work.
Eventually I'll rework the code to hopefully work and look cleaner.

The purpose of putting up my source code for the public is to hopefully help others who wish to get into making games with java in some way or another.

Included a license, for any of you who use some of my work please send me a link or some pictures or something so I can check it out.

More to add to this read-me as I come up with it, cya all in the next update wave.
