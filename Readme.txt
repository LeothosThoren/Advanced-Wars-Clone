This is my Advanced Wars clone project's source code by Serge-David from www.blog.knolif.com

Currently all the features are being slowly hacked together in this early stage of development (pre-alpha).
Eventually I'll rework the code to hopefully work and look cleaner as I get to the end of adding things.
The purpose of putting up my source code for the public is to hopefully help others who wish to get into making games with java in some way or another.
This project is under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, you should check out the License.txt file for more information about that.
For those of you that might use some of the code in this project, please send me a link (download / pictures / blog) so I can check out your project(s) as well.

My aims with this project is to improve my coding and game development skills with a focus on...
   1) Creating small map files which are created better then my previous attempts.
   2) Handle Game-States and Gui elements in a way that makes sense and is easy to use.
   3) Enter into the scary world of AI.
   4) Improve class independence (Several of my classes tend to leak around)
   5) A lot more.
   
I'll add to this read-me and the rest more later, cya all and thank you for any support / encouragement you give me.
I don't only make games because I love them and love making them, but because I love people enjoying them and I hope someday I'll finish one that people play.
